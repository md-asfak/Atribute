            <h1>Missile Man Of A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h1>
            <p> <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, </b>to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre
              of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father
              Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
              [10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
              now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
              [16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and
              large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim
              descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
              and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the
              opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and
              properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time
              Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>
